# ar_from_template

AR prototype app for "Life in a Box" by Cadie Desbiens-Desmeules.

Built from tutorial by Enrico Costi:

Includes a timer for changing scenes and audio/sound design for each scene, custom models for LIAB project.

This worked fine on Android however image recognition failed once it was built for iOS.
